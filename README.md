## Overview 

BotAgenda is a complete customizable bot that can add  work to do in the data base and show them with a command.

Installation is easy , and you do not need to know anything about coding. 

*The default set of module includes :* 

- **Add work**
- **Show work**

## Installation

First of all , you need a database , for my part I use UWamp . You can install it easily from internet.
This is an example of a database structure.

When your database is ready you need to install mysql in your workspace for this you have to use this command : **npm i mysql**.
After that you can change the differents settings in the code to create a connection to mysql.

## Use 

For the moment you can only:
- Add work with the command : !**addDevoir**
- Show work with the command : **!agenda** *( and the number of the day )*
